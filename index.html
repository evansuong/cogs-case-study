                <h2>You know Spotify...</h2>
                <p>the largest streaming platform out there, where hundreds of thousands of creators share their creations for the world to listen to. From it's snappy user interface, to its brilliant brand design, Spotify covers the needs of music listeners and artsts alike.</p>

            <div class="left">
                <h3>However...</h3>
                <p>As the music industry continues to migrate to the digital streaming world, the roadmap to becoming an established musical artist has largely remained the same: networking and collaborations. Our team found that promising young talent in music production/artistry lack opportunities to officially collaborate with established musicians through popular streaming services. After a little research we learned that Spotify clearly cares about this issue, and they have some features in place like curated playlists to help smaller artists get noticed. But there is still much room to grow.</p>

                <p>a collaboration and remixing feature on the Spotify platform, where music creators have the opportunity to participate in remix contests held within the Spotify platform by verified artists. Winning submissions are awarded by having their submission uploaded as a single in collaboration with the contest host, along with other prizes that are determined by the contest host.</p>

We also found that our fall into 2 categories: Contest Host, and Contest Participant, which gave us two benchmarks to validate our features with.</p>

We deliberately picked some controversial designs that would make it easy for users to comment on, whether they liked or disliked it. If they liked it, then we were able to come up with something robust and original, and if they didn't like it we could always adopt more popular designs that have proven to succeed.</p>

In their place we opted for more widely adopted UI components like a tab switcher instead of the dropdown, and an image icon instad of a large header image. We also incorporated a winners page, as our user testers almost unanimously suggested that we make all contest submissions and results avaiable after a contest has ended.</p>

                <h2>The Important Takeaways...</h2>
                <p>for me were very concentrated in the importance of user research and user testing. I've been a designer for fun for a while now, and most of my work was driven by the desire to make things that look cool and clean. Although I knew the importance of user research/testing, I never really felt like I needed it, and therefore never really knew the ways in which these processes were helpful. Through this case study, I found it to be an extremely forward thinking experience that has had a huge impact on shaping how I view our team's upcoming goals, problems, and objectives. When writing up the questions, I thought about what ambiguities existed in our team's roadmap to a finished product. This search for ambiguities created something like a snowball effect where I ended up with too many questions to ask. During the interview process I could see our roadmap being drawn out with the information my interviewees were providing.</p>
                <p>I think that our group did a solid job and came up with questions that would reveal paths to our finished product. The fact that I had a much better idea of what we need to do in order to design the best product we could signified to me that our user research had been solid after each round of interfacing with our users.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h2>Moving Foward...</h2>
                <p>Although we came to a final design that our team is all proud of, I can't help but feeling like there is much more to rolling out an actual redesign on an existing platform outside of the design process itself. I feel like there are tons of legal, budgeting, and technical obstacles that have to be accounted for during an endeavor like this. It would be cool to have to opportunity to dialogue with people in industry to see how such a redesign is made possible, and a redesign is carried out in industry.</p>
                <p>I also now understand how much time such a process takes, between the actual work to plan and create a design, and waiting on user feedback. This is a patience game that requires you to view, review, and review again to continuously improve my product, and as things begin to unravel themselves, I gain insights into topics that I never even knew existed when starting out. I think that this type of exploration is what I find super fun about Data Driven Design.</p>
